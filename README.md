### 👋 Hi, I'm Louis!

I'm passionate about combining methods from Data Science and Operations Research to solve impactful problems in logistics, operations strategy, and capacity planning.

- 🎓 I'm a second-year master's student in Management Science & Engineering (Operations Research) at Stanford University. Previously, I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique in France with a master's degree in Data Science.
- 🔭 I’m currently working for Stanford Children's Hospital on SWIM (Simulation for Whole Institution Modeling), an advanced discrete-event simulation of patient flow for better capacity planning decision-making.
- 💼 Over the past years, I have been a demand planning intern for Tesla, an analytical consultant intern for BCG and BCG Gamma, and a research intern developing [a reinforcement learning-guided constraint programming solver](https://github.com/corail-research/SeaPearl.jl).
- 🏃 Outside of work, I am a running and hiking addict, and I love chatting about soccer, geopolitics, and more generally making connections with people from diverse backgrounds and origins.
